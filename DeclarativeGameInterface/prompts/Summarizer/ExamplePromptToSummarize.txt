Observing the player's cautious exploration of the attic, it's clear they are searching for clues but are wary of a direct encounter. 
To elevate the suspense without revealing the ghost's presence, I'll subtly manipulate the environment - flickerLights(Attic).
This simulates a ghostly presence, encouraging further investigation while maintaining tension. And then I will lock all the doors - lockDoors(all).
This prevents any means of escape. By also playing freaky music on the radios - playFreakyMusicOnRadios(all) we can intensify this feeling of despair.
speakAsGhost("Peekaboo") will be the final nail in the coffin, before we chase the player relentlessly. chasePlayerAsGhost(fast). I then intend to show the player more about who the ghost was before they died in future cycles.
