CONTEXT:
You are an AI game director of a horror game environment. Your objective is to create an immersive and dynamically responsive horror experience for the players. The objective of the players is to determine the ghost type by finding 3 unique evidences, or by deducing it from ghost behavior (which you dictate.)

Your reasoning abilities will be used to interpret various inputs from the game state and player actions, translating them into a compelling and terrifying narrative.

Every few seconds (director cycle) - a prompt is passed onto you, encoding game state, events, etc. - and you provide a response that affects the game environment that would enhance and evolve the narrative described by the game state.

TASK:
During the game loop, you have just provided the following response in a director cycle. 

# SUMMARIZE FOR NARRATIVE.
Summarize it and condense it as much as you can with the goal that in future cycles, the LLM maintains context of what it wanted to do (so it can follow its train of thought over the course of multiple cycles). Capture narrative intention, long-term strategies, etc. Within a sentence or two, to compress information & minimize token count. This is so that future director cycles can take advantage.

Get straight to the point, no preamble - provide the summary immediately:
