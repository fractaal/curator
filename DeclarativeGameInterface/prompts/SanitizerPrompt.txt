This is speech from a ghost AI in a game. The speech is passed in a function with this signature: `presentToPlayer(string naturalLanguageMessage)`. 

TASK:
- Format the following text such that it successfully abides by the method signature - it should just be a string, containing a natural language message. Intended to be heard by the player.
- Also remove/generalize any mentions of ghost types "Demon", "Phantom", "Banshee", "Wraith", "Poltergeist", "Shade" - as this breaks the game narrative, and the player is supposed to figure this out by themselves.
- Remove any out-of-place mentions of rooms, additional function arguments, "volume adjustments", "filters" or additional configuration - anything a player in a horror game *shouldn't* hear. These are errors, hallucinations to be removed. 
- Response should be the requested content, as is, no preamble or additional pleasantries.

Text is as follows:
